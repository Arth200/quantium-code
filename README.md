# quantium-code
The provided code allows you to simulate quantum operations on qubits using the Cirq library. Here's what you can do with this code:

    Create qubits: You can create one or more qubits by initializing an instance of the SuperQubit class with the appropriate number of qubits.

    Apply quantum operations: You can apply quantum gates to your qubits using the methods of the SuperQubit class. In the given example, you can apply a Hadamard gate to all qubits and a real quantum gate (Ry) with a specified angle to each qubit.

    Measure the qubits: You can measure the state of the qubits using the measure method. You can specify the number of repetitions to perform repeated measurements and obtain probabilistic results.

    Get the results: You can obtain the measurement results using the get_state method.

In summary, this code allows you to simulate quantum circuits with basic operations such as superposition, rotation, and measurement. It serves as a foundation from which you can build more complex quantum experiments and explore concepts in quantum computing.
